# SpawnerDistance

Script that calculates the optimal distance between a player and a certain amount of mobspawners for the game Minecraft.

### Method

The method that I used is a brute force method.
The script starts with creating a search area with potential blocks.(min/max of X/Y/Z)(could be optimized)

In the second stage it will loop around all the potential blocks and save the sum of distances from the spawners to that block IF the distance&lt;16(A player can only activate a spawner when he/she is 16 blocks away from af spawner).

All important information will be appended into a list, some lists are sorted(the distance to find shortest Bigsum).

The last step will find the blocks that are linked to a specific distance(Blockindex)

### Requirements

1.  python (3 preferred)
2.  spawner coordinates (X, Y and Z)

### Usage

1.  Download the script.
2.  Edit the (TODO) Coordinate file
3.  Open a terminal(Windows, OSX, Linux) and execute the following command: `python3 SpawnerDistance.py`
4.  The output will look like this (an example): `The closest block to all spawners is: 364 , 35 , 928 . and you activate: 3  Spawners.`

if you use the script, please give credit to syntaxnoob and jellerijnders.
